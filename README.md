This damage calculator has been adapted from the official Pokemon Showdown! damage calculator for specific use with Drayano's ROM Hacks: Blaze Black 2 and Volt White 2. All competitive sets have been removed for ease of use. 

The changes that have been made for this calculator are the changes that Drayano made to pokemon stats, types and move characteristics. The full list of changes made by Drayano can be found on his personal Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B-zmEVN0Mas6ZGt0ZmVva2pYeTQ?resourcekey=0-2ujVwGdN8ypDAEFr813nCw. 

Currently all trainer sets up the end-credits come imported as default (note: all sets have neutral natures, as Dray's documentation does not list the nature of the pokemon).

This calculator can be used both online and offline:
  -  To use online, simply visit the following link: https://m-row1709.github.io/BB2-VW2-damage-calc/dist/index.html?gen=5
  -  To use offline, first download the entire GitHub repository. Navigate to the 'dist/' subdirectory, and open the file named 'index.html'.

Bugs with the calculator can be reported here on this GitHub repo, or by join the Discord server for this calculator: https://discord.gg/UBWysKDK

Credits go towards the original creators of the Pokemon Showdown! damage calculator, as without the calculator template this would not be possible.
